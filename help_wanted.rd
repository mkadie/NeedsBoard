Help finding individuals with unadressed Special needs
Going forward we need software engineers, I plan on breaking down this into small sections that we can colaberate on.
3d designers
Special Needs experts
Symbol / icon / emoji experts to help provide visual links to pre-literate individuals
Combinational Symbol / language experts.  An example would be the Symbol for liquid + brown = chocolate milk, house + food = I'm hungry
Web developer
