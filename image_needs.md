I need a set of 8 needs images for an assistive device I am making.  It is for a girl in Thailand.  These will be displayed on a 320x200 screen in 16 colors.  The images will be published in the open sourece project.  Eventually I hope to have a large library of these images for people to use free of charge to help with special needs individuals. Here are the images I need to get started.
Milk: A simple glass of milk.
Water: A simple glass of water.  probably same as milk with different colors
Snack: An apple, cookie, or sandwich.
Play: Trampoline, Toy blocks, or a ball.
Mom: A female figure.
Yes: A green checkmark and thumbs-up.
No: A red cross and thumbs-down.
Thank You: Hands in a prayer gesture (Thai).
