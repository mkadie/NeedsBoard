    - background in college in the early 90's I built 2 speach boards 2 children with different abilities that enabled them to communicate.  It seemed to help them, but I was warned that if I tried to make a business of it I would be sued.  So now I'm back to doing it for free, but better.  In the mean time I done little 'Half day' projects
